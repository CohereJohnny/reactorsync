# Demo Script for ReactorSync

## Overview
This script guides a live demo for Conexus Nuclear stakeholders, showcasing ReactorSync’s AI-driven reactor management. Narrative: Start with healthy reactors, trigger issues, resolve via UI/AI, highlight collaboration benefits.

## Step-by-Step Narrative
1. **Introduction (2 min)**: Present ReactorSync as a Conexus-aligned tool for CANDU/SMR management. Show dashboard (Card view).
2. **Healthy State (3 min)**: Toggle to Table/Map; drill into a reactor to show telemetry (Plotly charts).
3. **Trigger Issue (3 min)**: Admin mode; inject “Temp Spike” fault → Status turns red; UI alerts.
4. **Diagnose/Resolve (4 min)**: Use AI chat (Command A) to diagnose; query MCP tool for plan; reset to green.
5. **SMR Sim (3 min)**: Run site selection scenario; show generated plan.
6. **Wrap-Up (2 min)**: Highlight AI’s impact (e.g., “50% faster diagnostics”); invite feedback.

## Tips
- **Setup**: Preload 10 reactors; synthetic data ready.
- **Props**: Use localhost:3000; have MCP Inspector open.
- **Engagement**: Ask audience to suggest a fault type.
