# Sprint 2 Tasks - Database & Data Models

## Goals
Implement core data models and database schema for ReactorSync. This sprint focuses on connecting the backend to PostgreSQL, creating SQLAlchemy models, and establishing proper database operations for reactor management.

## Success Criteria
- SQLAlchemy models implemented for all core entities (Reactor, Telemetry, Fault, KnowledgeBase)
- Database migrations system established
- Backend API connected to PostgreSQL instead of static data
- CRUD operations working for reactor management
- Database connection pooling and error handling implemented
- Sample data loading automated

## Progress Notes

### Day 1 - SQLAlchemy Models Implementation ✅
**Completed Tasks**: 2.1

**Key Accomplishments**:
- ✅ Created comprehensive SQLAlchemy models for all core entities
- ✅ Implemented Reactor model with status tracking, health scores, and location data
- ✅ Built Telemetry model with time-series metrics and performance optimization indexes
- ✅ Added Fault model with severity levels and resolution tracking
- ✅ Developed KnowledgeBase model with pgvector support for semantic search
- ✅ Established proper model relationships and foreign key constraints
- ✅ Added business logic methods for health calculations and data validation

**Technical Highlights**:
- Used proper SQLAlchemy 2.0 syntax with modern declarative patterns
- Implemented composite indexes on telemetry table for query performance
- Added enum types for reactor status, type, and fault severity
- Created comprehensive to_dict() and from_dict() methods for API serialization
- Integrated pgvector for vector embeddings storage and similarity search
- Added health score calculation logic based on telemetry ranges

**Files Created**:
- `backend/models/__init__.py` - Model exports and imports
- `backend/models/base.py` - Database configuration and session management
- `backend/models/reactor.py` - Nuclear reactor facility model
- `backend/models/telemetry.py` - Time-series telemetry data model
- `backend/models/fault.py` - Fault and incident tracking model
- `backend/models/knowledge_base.py` - Document storage with vector embeddings

**Next Steps**:
- Set up Alembic for database migrations (Task 2.2)
- Create database migration from existing schema (Task 2.2)
- Implement CRUD operations and repository pattern (Task 2.4)
