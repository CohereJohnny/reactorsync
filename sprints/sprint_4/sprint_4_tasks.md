# Sprint 4 Tasks - API Foundation & Real-time Integration

## Goals
Complete the API foundation and real-time integration for ReactorSync. This sprint focuses on optimizing existing APIs, completing WebSocket integration, adding comprehensive testing, and preparing for dashboard development.

*Note: Original Sprint 4 goals were largely completed in Sprints 2-3. This sprint focuses on completion, optimization, and integration testing.*

## Success Criteria
- All API endpoints optimized and thoroughly tested
- WebSocket real-time integration fully functional
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Performance testing and optimization complete
- Integration testing with live data streaming
- System ready for dashboard development

## Tasks

### API Optimization & Completion
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Complete and optimize existing API endpoints
  - Enhance /reactors endpoint with advanced filtering and sorting
  - Optimize /telemetry/{reactor_id} with aggregation options
  - Add /reactors/{id}/health endpoint for health history
  - Implement /system/statistics endpoint for fleet overview
  - Add error handling and input validation

- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Implement comprehensive API documentation
  - Enhance FastAPI auto-generated documentation
  - Add detailed endpoint descriptions and examples
  - Create API usage guide and best practices
  - Document WebSocket protocols and message formats
  - Add authentication and rate limiting documentation (future-ready)

- [ ] **Task 4.3**: Add advanced reactor management endpoints
  - Implement POST /reactors for reactor creation
  - Add PUT /reactors/{id} for reactor updates
  - Create DELETE /reactors/{id} for reactor removal
