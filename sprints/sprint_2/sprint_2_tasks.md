# Sprint 2 Tasks - Database & Data Models

## Goals
Implement core data models and database schema for ReactorSync. This sprint focuses on connecting the backend to PostgreSQL, creating SQLAlchemy models, and establishing proper database operations for reactor management.

## Success Criteria
- SQLAlchemy models implemented for all core entities (Reactor, Telemetry, Fault, KnowledgeBase)
- Database migrations system established
- Backend API connected to PostgreSQL instead of static data
- CRUD operations working for reactor management
- Database connection pooling and error handling implemented
- Sample data loading automated

## Tasks

### Database Models & Schema
