### Development Environment
- [ ] **Task 1.8**: Establish basic CI/CD pipeline structure
  - Create GitHub Actions workflow files
  - Add basic linting and testing checks
  - Configure build validation for frontend and backend
  - Set up Docker image building pipeline

- [x] **Task 1.9**: Create development documentation
  - Write comprehensive `docs/setup.md`
  - Document Docker Compose usage
  - Add troubleshooting guide
  - Create contributor guidelines

### Integration & Testing
- [ ] **Task 1.10**: Verify complete development environment
  - Test Docker Compose startup sequence
  - Verify service connectivity and health checks
  - Validate frontend-backend communication
  - Test database connectivity and pgvector functionality
  - Document any setup issues and resolutions

## Progress Notes

### Day 1 - Infrastructure Foundation Complete
**Completed Tasks**: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.9

**Key Accomplishments**:
- ✅ Complete repository structure established following project specifications
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration created with all required services (frontend, backend, mcp-server, db, streaming, data-generator, redis)
- ✅ NextJS 14+ frontend initialized with TypeScript, ShadCN UI, and essential dependencies
- ✅ FastAPI backend created with structured project layout and comprehensive dependencies
- ✅ PostgreSQL database configured with pgvector extension and sample data
- ✅ Development documentation created with comprehensive setup guide

**Technical Highlights**:
- Used UV package manager for Python dependency management with locked requirements

- Added health checks to all Docker services for proper orchestration
- Created comprehensive database schema with sample reactor and telemetry data
- Implemented structured logging with structlog in FastAPI backend

**Files Created**:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Complete service orchestration
- `frontend/` - NextJS app with ShadCN and TypeScript
- `backend/` - FastAPI app with UV dependency management
- `db/init.sql` - Database schema with sample data
- `docs/setup.md` - Comprehensive development guide
- `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `.env.example` - Project configuration

**Next Steps**:
- Complete CI/CD pipeline setup (Task 1.8)
- Verify complete environment with integration testing (Task 1.10)
